# Understand the project

## Webpack
In order to understand this project we need to understand how webpack works. Please visit
Learn-Webpack in the parent directory

## React
Later comes the concept of React. In order to understand React, we need to understand 
how a react component is made, how the component stores it's state privately and 
allows only to change it with setState method.

## Redux
Later we understand how two components interact through their parent component.
For handling complex heirarchy of components communicating among each other, we need an organized
approach. Redux provides that approach through one store, one provider, dumb component, 
smart components,
actions and reducers.

## Material
Later on, we learn to use material design components in our components heirarchy. In order to learn
that please visit Learn-React in the parent directory.

## Citation
I learnt the basics of React and Redux pretty quickly with Bucky roberts: [Bucky Roberts Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston)

I learnt the basics of webpack: [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/)

I learnt the basics of how to use material design for React application from: [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui)

I used the boiler plate from Bucky Roberts's github profile.

Developing further on that I need to use some UI components from material 
Design
