# Note_Sandbox
A sandbox for Note application

# Introduction

## I am creating this note application in React

While creating this application I started with [getting-started-seed-project-in-redux](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Redux-Boilerplate):
 You can find that replicated [here](https://github.com/liberaldart/Note_Sandbox/tree/master/Learn-React-Redux-Boilerplate) in my project.
 

## I want to share my learning.
 
 I learnt a good deal of ES6, React, Redux, Webpack, Material-UI in this process. You can start with [here](https://github.com/liberaldart/Note_Sandbox/tree/master/Learn-React-Redux-Boilerplate) and follow
 the readme files from there. The READMEs will take you along the learning curve and you will get to learn modern application
 development if you tag along.

# Learnings

## Learnt the ideas of React: Do the react getting started guide before any associated library. 

YouTube playlist by Bucky Roberts was a great help to begin with React real quick.

## Learnt the ideas of following getting started tutorials: 

Getting started tutorials are worth looking at first. Look for alternate resources in Quora, YouTube and Google only after you need to move further in the learning activity.

## Learnt the importance of being able to teach self after learning. 

Follow Fynman's technique to understand the holes in your own understanding.

## Learnt about the need of Redux and the architecture of Redux. 

Followed the getting started tutorial and a playlist on YouTube by Bucky Roberts. Also, redux is independent of 
react. It works with other frameworks that allow for working with the UI through states.
 
## Beginning to learn about the importance of RxJS as a library. 

Redux is just a state manager but the states must be handled synchronously. For async operations we need RxJS.

## Learnt about the importance of Containers.

I am organizing the code into containers and components after watching the following video:
