# Note_Sandbox
A sandbox for Note application

# Introduction

## I am creating this note application in React

While creating this application I started with [getting-started-seed-project-in-redux](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Redux-Boilerplate):
 You can find that replicated [here](https://github.com/liberaldart/Note_Sandbox/tree/master/Learn-React-Redux-Boilerplate) in my project.
 

## I want to share my learning.
 
 I learnt a good deal of ES6, React, Redux, Webpack, Material-UI in this process. You can start with [here](https://github.com/liberaldart/Note_Sandbox/tree/master/Learn-React-Redux-Boilerplate) and follow
 the readme files from there. The READMEs will take you along the learning curve and you will get to learn modern application
 development if you tag along.
 
## Please ask questions if you need information regarding this application
